This academic-industry fusion allowed GUVI to build upon a foundation of scholarly rigor and entrepreneurial drive .
Founding Journey
While the precise founding year isn’t stated in our primary sources, early press and platform archives suggest the mid-2010s period. Typically, startup profile aggregators like Tracxn and Himalayas note the founding team and dates—though I’d want to cross-verify those with trusted media or official quotes .
Founders and Leadership
The core founding team includes individuals proficient in both tech and business. Incubation at premier institutions helped seed the vision of democratizing tech education—particularly for learners who prefer vernacular instruction.
Early Goals and Local Focus
From its inception, GUVI’s unique approach was to deliver coding, AI, and career readiness content in regional Indian languages—notably Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and more. This “mother-tongue advantage” enabled deeper comprehension and inclusion among non-English speakers .

Articles About Guvi
?GUVI? (Grab Your Vernacular Imprint), a startup based in Chennai, is imagining a world where tech talent isn’t dependent on English skills. This vernacular-first strategy has proven particularly effective for first-generation college students from non-metro areas. “When you eliminate the struggle of understanding the medium, learners can actually focus on understanding the concept. That’s a major cognitive shift,” founder and CEO Arun Prakash tells YourStory. From YouTube tutorials to full-time commitment The foundation of GUVI dates back to 2011 when Arun Prakash, then a software engineer at PayPal, visited his alma mater in Madurai. “Students were still being trained on outdated tools and programming languages. It was almost as if time had stood still since I graduated. That triggered something in me—I felt responsible to do something,” recalls Arun. Get connected to GUVI He began recording short codingtutorials in Tamil, often blending technical English terms. These videos, uploaded to YouTube under the ‘GUVI’ banner, attracted unexpected attention. “People started messaging me from not just Tamil Nadu, but from Malaysia, Singapore, and even the Middle East, saying that this was the first time they were able to truly understand coding,” he shares. The feedback revealed an unmet demand for tech education in regional languages. Despite the encouraging response, GUVI remained a side project for several years. Arun registered the platform in 2012 while continuing his full-time job. It wasn't until 2017 that he committed to GUVI full-time, joined by his wife Sridevi Arunprakash, who became the platform’s first employee, and PayPal colleague Bala Murugan SP. Get connected to GUVI The trio bootstrapped the initial operations with a personal investment of around Rs 10 lakh, with Sridevi managing operations, contentreviews, and voiceovers in the early phase. Beyond translation: The transcreation model Chennai-based GUVI’s courses are designed and delivered by a blend of in-house educators, linguistic experts, and active industry professionals. The content follows a layered language strategy that integrates native languages with technical English, using a ‘transcreation’ approach to make learning culturally and contextually relevant—particularly for first-generation and non-metro learners. “It’s not about dubbing; it’s about making content make sense within a learner’s world,” says Arun. When teaching a concept like ‘for loop,’ GUVI retains the English term for industry familiarity but explains it in the learner’s native language, such as Tamil, using relatable analogies like taking attendance. “This transcreation adapts both words and context, embedding technical ideas in everyday scenarios. By layering native language with key English terms, we helps first-generation and non-metro learners grasp and apply complex concepts more easily,” he adds. GUVI currently offers structured self-paced and live courses across 16 languages—11 Indian languages such as Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali, and Kannada, along with five international languages including Arabic and Malay. The platform has developed over 600 self-paced modules in fields such as Python, Java, full-stack development, artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, digital marketing, and emerging technologies like semiconductors and generative AI. The course designers include technical educators in domains like Python, AI, data science, and cybersecurity, as well as language specialists who localise content in 16 languages. Tutors are practicing professionals who conduct live sessions, mentor learners on hands-on projects, and ensure the curriculum remains aligned with evolving industry trends such as generative AI and semiconductors. Dual engine of growth GUVI operates on a hybrid B2C and B2B business model. On the B2C side, it provides self-paced and instructor-led courses priced from Rs 500 to Rs 1.5 lakh. These offerings are targeted at both working professionals and students looking to improve their employment prospects. The B2B segment includes partnerships with enterprises such as TCS, Deloitte, Tech Mahindra, and KPMG, through which GUVI delivers upskillingprograms, compliance training, and certifications. As an SAP Sell partner, the platform is also investing in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) training for enterprise clients. Its current user base is approximately 2.4 million. Furthering its institutional reach, GUVI has collaborated with government platforms like Swayam Plus to enable credit-bearing learning and is also working with universities to integrate its courses into academic credit and placement frameworks. As of FY24, GUVI reported annual revenues of approximately Rs 15 crore and is targeting Rs 70 crore by FY25. The platform is preparing for an SME IPO between FY26 and FY27. “We’ve started putting in place systems and governanceframeworks. The IPO will help institutionalise our structure and allow long-term planning,” says Arun. Learner demographics and global expansion GUVI’s learner base is primarily composed of working professionals, who make up about 60% of users, followed by students who account for 30–40%. The startup is now looking to expand globally by entering markets like the Middle East and Australia through partnerships. “We don’t own the P&L in those geographies. Local partners manage business operations while we provide the content, platform infrastructure, and delivery systems,” Arun explains. Also Read This Kota-Based Startup Wants To Change How India Eats Breakfast Over the next two years, GUVI plans to enter additional Asian and Gulf markets. Resilience and challenges Despite its growth, GUVI has faced multiple challenges. One of the most persistent is the societal bias linking intelligence with English fluency. “Many still believe that if you don’t speak English, you’re not smart enough for tech. This mindset extended beyond individual learners, affecting institutions and employers as well,” says Arun. The platform also endured a personal and operational setback in 2020 with the passing of co-founder Sridevi Arunprakash. “She was the backbone of our operations. After her loss, rebuilding internal systems while maintaining continuity was incredibly difficult,” he reflects. Externally, the platform has had to navigate industry fluctuations, such as hiring slowdowns and evolving tech demands. GUVI has stayed agile by updating its curriculum in high-demand areas like semiconductors and generative AI, and by ensuring mentors are active industry practitioners to maintain practical relevance. India's coding and marking market is projected to see a CAGR of 9.87% from 2025-2032, with a value of $327.64 million in 2024 and a revenue of $700.22 million by 2032, according to INKWOOD research. “Our journey is not just about language or content. It’s about creating access—access that’s authentic, relatable, and transformative,” Arun concludes.

GUVI is an integrated EduTech platform that provides technical skills in local languages with end-to-end personalized support throughout the process of learning to recruitment. Arun Prakash, S.P. Balamurugan, and Sridevi founded the platform. While working together at PayPal, they observed a huge gap in the technological skills of fresh graduates in India, especially in computer programming. According to recent reports.
 
What started in 2014 as a YouTube channel to share technical knowledge has rapidly evolved into one of the biggest online EduTech platforms in South India.
 
“I remember posting a short YouTube video on the basics of programming in C/C++ in the local language-a mix of Tamil and English. That video became quite popular quickly!” Arun, the co-founder of GUVI, noted in one of the boot camp events of the Financial Inclusion (FI) lab.
 
“That was a light bulb moment for us. We suddenly realized the huge opportunity to bridge this skilling gap through the creation of an integrated learning and recruitment platform to cater to the talented but unskilled technical graduates from tier II and III cities,” he continued.
  
The unique pitch
 
GUVI’s mission is to make skilling an easy, simple, and intuitive process by bridging the gap between skilling and recruitment. On this platform, students can learn in their local languages through bite-sized videos, practice coding, test their skills, and compare their progress against their peers. GUVI attempts to make learning fun for its students through a gamified platform to practice coding, which awards “merit badges” to students who complete a course successfully. It also conducts periodic assessments and coding contests and rewards the top performers. The entire learning history of a student is maintained as part of their GUVI profile, which they can share with potential and current employers.
 
GUVI works on two models-an online learning platform that has been described briefly in the “unique pitch” section and an offline model that includes zen classes, which is a special classroom coaching model. As part of zen classes, GUVI handpicks students, trains them through industry experts, and finally places them with potential recruiters. Thus far, GUVI has been able to secure placements for all of its four zen class batches.
 
Skilling learners in the times of Covid-19
 
That Guvi’s model is relevant and popular with learners can be gauged by the fact that as on date (26 th April, 2020), 62,000 new learners have joined the platform to upskill themselves since India went into a country-wide lockdown on 21st March, 2020. This led to a significant jump from 250,000 to 312,000 learners that are now registered on Guvi’s platform since the pre-lockdown period. Now on an average, a learner spends 20 times more learning hours per week compared to the time they spent during the pre-March 2020 period. Testament to its success is the fact that GUVI raised in April 2020 INR 6 crore in a pre-series A round of funding from Education Catalyst Fund.
 
 
Impact on the LMI segment
 
In India, students from tier II and III cities face the following challenges:
 
* They are not exposed to quality technical education in schools and colleges because quality instructors in this domain are usually found in tier I cities where they are paid better
* They struggle to read, understand, and write in English, which is the common medium of teaching technical courses and coding languages.
 
Unable to overcome these challenges, such students find it difficult to acquire the requisite skills to attain appropriate jobs.
 
GUVI, through its low-priced, local language platform and on-demand, simplified computer programming courses, has up-skilled more than 150,000 students, mostly from the LMI segment, and helped them be recruited in respectable technology firms.
 
Support provided by the Financial Inclusion lab
 
GUVI was selected for the Financial Inclusion Lab in its second cohort in March 2019, as part of which the start-up went through boot camps, diagnostic sessions, and clinic sessions with that provided bespoke technical assistance to achieve the following objectives:
 
* Understand the nuances of the fresher recruitment ecosystem of North India. This also included opportunities and market sizing of the business opportunities of GUVI with small, medium, and large technology enterprises and training and placement consultancies;
* Develop a cost-effective go-to-market (GTM) strategy by identifying the product-market fit for GUVI from among the technology and placement companies explored earlier; and
* Identify any overlooked skills to help GUVI differentiate itself from its competitors.
 
While the support of the Financial inclusion Lab continues, GUVI has already been able to achieve the following milestones:
 
* Partnerships with its most relevant enterprise segment-small and medium-sized technology firms in the north;
* Involved in strategic partnership discussions with prestigious IT industry associations such as NASSCOM, which has a pan-India presence and influence; and
* Built and incorporated soft-skill training modules in its platform to augment the employability of its trainees.
 
As a result, GUVI witnessed an improvement in the number of recruiters who joined its platform alongside an increase in the success rate of placement of its students or trainees, both in North and South India.
 
Skilling learners in the times of Covid-19
 
GUVI has become more relevant and popular for learners. Now, a learner spends, on an average, 20 times more hours per week as compared to time spent during the pre-March 2020 period.
 
Witnessing the immense success in terms of the number of learners on the platform, GUVI has also re-invented it’s B2B2C business model, in which it offers its courses and platform to engineering colleges completely online, due to broader market situation. GUVI has also proactively moved its Zen classes, one of the most popular and successful ones, completely online because of the lockdown and social distancing norms.
 
GUVI firmly believes that they can overcome the barriers of the background, region, situation, or financial status to skill any willing learner.
